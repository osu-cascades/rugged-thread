## Test Suite

We use minitest, and you can run the test suite with `rails test` and
`rails test:system`. At the time of this writing (see `git blame README`), the
application doesn't use any client-side JavaScript, so the system tests use the
`:rack_test` driver to speed up the system tests.
See _test/application_system_test_case.rb_.

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions - forthcoming (heroku)
